## Intro

We value your privacy. That’s why we do not **collect** or **store** any personally-identifying data, locally or on our servers. We don’t and we won’t sell your data to anyone, **ever**!

We do not **track** you either. The analytics and crash reports we have are all provided by Apple, based on your consent and everything is anonymous.

## Data

The data gathered by the app is stored using Apple's provided API (SwiftData) and synced on your personal and private iCloud storage thanks to Apple's provided API (CloudKit).

Your data is yours, you can export it whenever you want. You can check the data we store, it's minimal by design.

## Analytics and Crash reports

The only analytics we have and use to improve our app (acquisition, retention, performance,…) are the analytics and crash reports provided by Apple through App Store Connect.

The information is collected, stored and shared with us anonimously by Apple.

You can enable (opt-in) or disable (opt-out) that anytime you want from your device’s Settings.
